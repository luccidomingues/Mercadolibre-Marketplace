# Mercadolibre-Marketplace

Description:
In the context of Mercadolibre's Marketplace an algorithm is needed to predict if an item listed in the marketplace is new or used.

My task involves the data analysis, designing, processing and modeling of a machine learning solution to predict if an item is new or used and then evaluate the model over held-out test data.

To assist in that task a dataset is provided in `MLA_100k_checked_v3.jsonlines` and a function `build_dataset` to read that dataset in `new_or_used.py`.
